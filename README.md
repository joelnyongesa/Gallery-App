## Introduction

The Gallery App is a web application developed for our Week 2 Catch-Up Session on July 27, 2023. It serves as a platform to showcase various art pieces, including details about the piece's name, owner, and price. The app also allows users to submit new pieces to the gallery through a form, and these submissions will be dynamically added to the existing collections displayed.
